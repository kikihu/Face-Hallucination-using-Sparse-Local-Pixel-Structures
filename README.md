##### Configuration:
--------------------

All required parameters are configured via global variables decalred in app.m


##### Run:
----------

Run app.m which is the entry point of the program
Include image processing and computer vision toolboxes in Matlab
The steps are separated into their own functions and each function is in its own
.m file


##### Steps:
------------

* The program does the following procedures in order:

1. PCA algorithm.

2. KNN algorithm.

3. Cut the images into patches.

4. L1LS sparse learning on patches.

5. Reconstruct the target high-resolution face image.


##### Testing:
--------------

* The program tests for accuracy using:

1. MSE.
2. PSNR.
3. SSIM.


The L1LS is tested by applying reverse equation Y^ = X' . A after obtaining X'
using L1LS, then Y^ is compared to Y
